                    <dd> All things considered, the way things are today, tech is essentially in all that we do; from the most fundamental business exercises to the greatest enterprises on the planet, everything rotates around tech. What's more, tech has a spot for everybody, to the extent that you procure an expertise in tech, then you can work anyplace.</dd>

                        I could say I have an enthusiasm for web advancement, yet that would be clearly false! I didn't pick web advancement, I think the converse is the situation; Web advancement picked me. The vocation way I planned to pick was that of a Financial specialist, however at that point I was acquainted with canva, then from canva I got into website architecture and was subsequently acquainted with figma. Along the line, while planning on figma, I got to comprehend that we must be exact about the components and characteristics, that it was these apparatuses that designers would use in building the site pages and furthermore make it capability as per the client's fulfillment. I just got keen on really fabricating my little starter plan into a site page and I chose to check it out, so I observed some youtube recordings and was truly ready to construct my clone website page. it was difficult, however I found the test exceptionally inviting and the occassional dissatisfactions very acceptable.

                        <h3>My objectives in upskill</h3>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>I joined the Genesys Upskill program by goodness of karma through a companion of mine who saw that learning web improvement was giving me a difficult stretch, and furthermore realized I was unable to pay for genuine classes. He enlightened me regarding Upskill and how it was a free program and how joining would give me open doors and, with karma, perhaps gain me genuine business. <br> <br>

                    The point is to begin with Genesys Upskill, then, at that point, I pay for and get a testament of finish in the wake of getting done with the tasks. From that point, I'll apply for and join the learnable program and subsequent to finishing the program and accepting my testament, ideally as i've heard, have the option to learn and work there as an understudy, and ideally once more, be held to fill in as a frontend designer. <br><br>
                    
                    The Ultimate objective is to turn into a fullstack designer however, yet I surmise very much like every other person, I really want to begin some place first to get to some place. Furthermore, I trust it's a gradual process; the more I practice and work on frontend projects, the better I get. Furthermore, the better I get, the simpler it is to coordinate myself into backend.

                    <dd>the closing elements/tags are those tags that requires an additional tag with <q>/</q> sign to identify its a closing tag. these tags contains contents in between the opening and closing tags.

                    <dd>In other hand, the self closing tags does not requie any closing tag as they do not require any content as they just play some roles in an HTML document. <br>
